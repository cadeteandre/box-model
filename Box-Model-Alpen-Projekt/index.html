                We choose hotels which offer a great location, 
                a high standard of comfort and quality, and a 
                solid value to our guests. These inns offer a s
                uperbly satisfying mix of a welcoming atmosphere, 
                traditional cuisine, and authentic charm. 
                They are typically small, independently-owned 
                properties which reflect the character and hospitality 
                of the surrounding alpine community. We know the 
                owners personally, have a longstanding relationship 
                with them, and we find they bend over backwards to 
                provide our guests with an exceptional experience.
